# Student Enrollment Form using JsonPowerDB
## Description
This project is a simple yet powerful student enrollment form built using HTML, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. The form is designed to interact with the JsonPowerDB, a high-performance NoSQL database, to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on student records. The form handles the following fields: Roll-No, Full-Name, Class, Birth-Date, Address, and Enrollment-Date, with Roll-No acting as the primary key.

## Benefits of using JsonPowerDB
